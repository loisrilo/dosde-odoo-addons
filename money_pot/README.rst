Money Pot
=========

Have you ever had a money pot to share expenses among tripmates, flatmates or
similar? Isn't it painful to add an initial amount to the pot, maybe readd
later and eventually split the remaining? Just make a virtual pot to record
all the expenses and split then add the very end with minimum cash moves!

Ok... this module doesn't split at the end (maybe someday will) but it already
does the first half of the job.
